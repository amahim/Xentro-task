## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
### 1. Open the terminal and run "npm i"
### 1. You can use user's email from this api (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) such as(Sincere@april.biz) for login as any other mail wont work!
### 1. Basically I've implemented all the given instruction but add and delete product won't work as the api's doesn't access POST,DELETE requests!Yet I've implemented them in project code.
